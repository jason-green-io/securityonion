This is my version of how to create a custom install of Security Onion 
using Ubuntu seed files and the Ubuntu server ISO. It was build with Dell R710 in mind
so includes the Dell management software. fluxbox and xorg are also installed to run
sosetup at the console or using an iDRAC remotely.

so.seed needs to go into /isobuld/preseed

addtoisolinux.cfg needs to be added to the end of isolinux.cfg
