This is my version of how to create a custom install of Security Onion 
using Ubuntu seed files and the Ubuntu server ISO. It was built with Dell R710/R610 in mind
so includes the Dell management software. fluxbox and xorg are also installed to run
sosetup at the console or using an iDRAC remotely.

so.seed needs to go into /isobuild/preseed

txt.cfg needs to replace the one in /isobuild/isolinux
