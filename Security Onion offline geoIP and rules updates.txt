TODO:



write a script (maybe called geo-update) that:

links snorby geoip to elsa geoip
updates elsa files from /tmp
updates squert files from /tmp

so you'd copy the files (geoIP, ip2 AND the rules) from a net connected server in /tmp of an unconnected server and every day the offline server would check and update itself, then, like cron.d/rule-update, geo-update would check if it's a sensor or server and copy the files from the server if a sensor .. a slight modification ro rule-update is also necessary
